          But I would also like to set aside part of my deployed lab to thanking a few specifically.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most of all, thank you to my wife, Rachel. The only way I could have gotten this far is with a wife who is willing
          to know what it means and be supportive when you say "There's something up with the DNS, my server is down so do you
          mind if I run upstairs real quick?" Thank you for listening to me try to explain what I think is wrong in the lab. 
          There's a lot to be said for that kind of support.
        </p>

          Thank you for to my parents, Marcie and Leslie. Mom and Pop, thank you for always wanting me to learn. For reading to me when I was younger. 
          I can't really say enough about how possible you have made everything by fostering a home that values growth and creativity.
        </p>

          David Levine. Thanks for challenging me. For knowing how to take sarcastic ideas and make them a realistic goal for me to learn and reach towards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle. For encouraging me in ways that go beyond programming and IT. For many times being so good at things that I look up
          and want to teach myself these kinds of skills to keep up with. For always wanting to be my teammate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grandma. For being responsible for basically our whole family and a beacon of wisdom my whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you to everyone else who I don't have enough screen space for on this page right now.
